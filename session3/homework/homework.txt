1. What are the main functional differences between a while and a for? 
while:
  -while True: infinite loop
   while False: end defintely the loop.

for: - for i in range (): finite loop (countable)

2. What’s the difference between break and continue? 

break
Jumps out of the closest enclosing loop (past the entire loop statement)

continue
Jumps to the top of the closest enclosing loop (to the loop’s header line)

3. When is a loop’s else clause executed?

-The else clause is only executed when your while condition becomes false. If you break out of the loop, or if an exception is raised, it won't be executed.


 
4. How can you code a counter-based loop in Python? 

- use a coode that can make the whole code above run in wrong way or set the times after which code is no longer working.


5. What can a range be used for in a for loop?

-For one thing, they provide a simple way to repeat an action a specific number of times. To print three lines, for example, use a range to generate the
 appropriate number of integers: 
>>> for i in range(3):     
	print(i, 'Pythons')
	0 Pythons 
	1 Pythons 
	2 Pythons
