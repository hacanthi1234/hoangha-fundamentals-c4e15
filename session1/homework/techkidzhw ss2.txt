1.What is Boolean? Write down 3 different expression that results a Boolean type (i.e. 5 == 6)

- Boolean value: A Boolean value is either true or false. It is named after the British mathematician, George Boole, who ?rst formulated Boolean algebra
—some rules for reasoning about and combining these values. This is the basis of all modern computer logic. 
In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False (the capitalization must be exactly as shown), and the Python type is bool.

>>> type(True) 
<class ’bool’> 
>>> type(true) 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "<interactive input>", line 1, in <module> NameError: name ’true’ is not defined
  
- Bolean expression: A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value. For example, the operator == tests 
if two values are equal.

- For ex:
6 == (3+3)
-> True
6 == 7
-> False
j = "hel"
j + "lo" = "hello"
-> True

2. What is a flow chart? Draw flow chart for the following code snippet: (you can draw on a paper, take a picture of it)
if name == “Huy be":
    print(“Hand some")
elif name == “Huy big":
    even_more_handsome = True
else:

- A flowchart is a visual representation of the sequence of steps and decisions that are needed to perform a process.

3. What is nested conditionals? Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals:
- Nested conditionals statement means using one if or else if statement inside another if or else if.

For instance: Above =))))
